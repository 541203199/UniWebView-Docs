# Using Prefab

[Prefab](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html) is fastest way to integrate a web view to your project. You can find `UniWebView.prefab` under `UniWebView/Prefab` folder in your project. Drag it to the scene you need to show a web view. Then you can configure its properties in the Inspector Tab.
