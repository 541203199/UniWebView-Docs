# Working with Code

In this tutorial, we will see how to create and use UniWebView by code. First, we will create an `GameObject` in a new scene, then attach `UniWebView` component to it. After that, we will try to load a sample page and play it. By end of the tutorial, you will learn the essential working flow of UniWebView and the most widely used features like JavaScript invoking and UniWebView messaging system.

Enough talk, let's begin.

### Creating a UniWebView

You could start from a new Unity project, then import UniWebView to the newly created project. Simply importing from Unity Asset Store or opening the UniWebView unity package file should do the trick. You could keep all default importing files since we are working in the new project. If you haven't read the [Installation guide](/latest/installation), we recommend you that you should take several minutes to do that now. Remember to restart your Unity Editor after the importing process done, it will give Unity Editor a chance to load UniWebView editor plugin.

The first task is creating a UniWebView and make it show our content. In [previous chapter](/latest/using-prefab), we did this with the prefab. Here, since we want more control on the UniWebView component, we will do it in code this time. 

Open a new scene, and add a `GameObject`
